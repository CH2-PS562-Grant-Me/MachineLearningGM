We initially planned to use content-based filtering, but we failed to develop the code.

For dataset, initially we use scholarship_features (scholarship's profile, consists of 13 rows and five features) and user_feature (user's profile, consist of 12000 rows and four features).

Because we keep encounter shapes problem with these dataset, we modify the dataset. The new one is scholarship_features_f (consists of 12000 rows and five features)

Therefore, the model can't predict properly.

We try to separate the neural network for both user and scholarship and use the outputs for final neural network on second attempt But, we encounter errors again.

================================

SUMMARY

Why we failed:
- Shapes problem
- Might misunderstand how the algorithm works

Our efforts:
- Modify the dataset (suspected being one of the problems too)
- Try to separate the neural networks
- Ask and finding solutions on several online forums (deeplearning.AI community, discords server, Stack Overflow, etc)
- Searching tutorials on YouTube (but we don't find what we really needed from the videos we watched)
